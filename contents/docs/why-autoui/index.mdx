AUTOUI solves one core problem: **turning natural language requests into safe, deterministic UI + function execution in your app**.

Instead of building one-off “chat flows”, you describe your app once (via `AutoUIConfig`) and the assistant can:

- Call your registered **functions**
- Render your registered **React components**
- Return a structured plan that the runtime can validate and execute

## Why the plugin is necessary

LLMs can hallucinate. Without guardrails, they may produce:

- wrong function names
- missing/extra params
- wrong prop shapes for components

The `@autoai-ui/autoui/plugin` exists to generate a **type-based runtime schema** (from your real TypeScript code) so AUTOUI can validate plans before executing them.

<Note title="Result" type="success">
With the schema + `runtime.validateLLMOutput: true`, AUTOUI can catch invalid params/props early instead of crashing your app.
</Note>

## The key functions (what they do)

### `autouiTypeSchemaPlugin()` (Vite plugin)

- **What it does**: scans your project during dev/build and generates `.autoui-runtime-schema.json`
- **Why it matters**: the schema powers runtime validation and helps the assistant understand your function/component types

### `autouiRegisterFunctionParamsSchema(fn)`

- **What it does**: “marks” a function so the plugin can discover it and extract its parameter types
- **When to use**: for every function you want AUTOUI to be able to validate (and that you later expose in `config.functions`)

### `autouiRegisterComponentPropsSchema(Component)`

- **What it does**: “marks” a React component so the plugin can discover it and extract its props types
- **When to use**: for every component you want AUTOUI to be able to validate (and that you later expose in `config.components`)

## The other half: `AutoUIConfig`

Even if you register a function/component for schema extraction, AUTOUI can only call/render what you explicitly expose in your config:

- `config.functions`: what the assistant is allowed to call
- `config.components`: what the assistant is allowed to render
