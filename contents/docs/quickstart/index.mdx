Welcome to AUTOUI! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Choose Your Framework

AUTOUI works with any React-based framework. Select your framework to see the specific setup instructions:

- **[React Quick Start](/docs/quickstart/react)** - For Create React App, Vite, or any React application
- **[Next.js Quick Start](/docs/quickstart/nextjs)** - For Next.js applications (App Router or Pages Router)

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 16+ installed
- A React application (or create one)
- A backend proxy server (see [Backend Proxy Installation](/docs/backend-proxy) for setup)

## Quick Overview

AUTOUI integration involves three main steps:

1. **Install the package** - Add `@autoai-ui/autoui` to your project
2. **Create a config** - Define your app's capabilities in an `AutoUIConfig` object
3. **Add ModalChat** - Import and render the `<ModalChat>` component
