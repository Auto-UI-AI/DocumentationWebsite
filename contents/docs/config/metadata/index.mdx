`metadata` is optional, but strongly recommended. It gives the LLM extra context about your product and improves decision-making.

## Partial example

```ts
metadata: {
  appName: "My App",
  appVersion: "0.1.0",
  author: "Your Team",
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  description:
    "Explain what the app does and what the assistant should help with. Add constraints and tone rules.",
  tags: ["demo", "react"],
}
```

## `metadata.appName` (required inside metadata)

- Human-readable name used as context.

## `metadata.description` (recommended)

- This is where you can be explicit about behavior rules.
- Great place to add:
  - “Always respond politely”
  - “If user intent is unclear, suggest UI actions”
  - “Don’t expose secrets”

## `metadata.tags` (optional)

- Useful for organization and search.
- Keep to short strings.
