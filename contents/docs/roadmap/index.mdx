This page is a living list of **ideas we want to implement next**.

## Planned ideas

- **Create a built-in dynamic component renderer** that can render basically anything in any format depending on the user request.
- **Create built-in library hooks** for better interaction with the chat from any place in your project.
- **Improve error handling** across runtime + proxy boundaries.
- **Reduce LLM calling cost** (smarter retries, caching, smaller prompts, fewer round-trips).
- **Extend AUTOUI to more frameworks** (Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.) — not only React.
- **Make rendering faster** (UI performance improvements).
- **Optimize runtime logic** so plan execution is faster (we have ideas to optimize “running plan instructions” logic).
- **Fully automatic component + function generation** via build-time analysis (plugin + AI) so users don’t have to write config manually.
