AUTOUI is an npm library that integrates a ready-to-use **ModalChat** component into any React application. Instead of building chat interfaces from scratch, you provide a configuration object that describes your app's capabilities, and AUTOUI handles the rest—from LLM communication to plan execution to UI rendering.

## How AUTOUI Works

AUTOUI follows a **config-driven architecture** where your application's capabilities are defined declaratively. Here's the high-level flow:

```
User → ModalChat → Proxy Server → OpenRouter/LLM → Plan JSON → Frontend Runtime → Functions/Components
```

<Step>
<StepItem title="1. User Interaction">
A user opens the ModalChat widget and sends a message or request.
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="2. Config Transmission">
ModalChat sends your `AutoUIConfig` to the proxy server, which includes:
- App metadata and description
- Available functions and components
- Runtime settings
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="3. LLM Processing">
The proxy server forwards the request to OpenRouter (or another LLM provider) with your config. The LLM generates a structured **plan**—a JSON response that describes what actions to take.
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="4. Plan Execution">
The frontend runtime receives the plan and executes it step-by-step:
- Calls registered functions with parameters
- Renders registered React components
- Updates UI state
- Handles errors and retries
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="5. Response Generation">
The runtime collects results from function calls and component renders, then sends this context back to the LLM for the next turn of conversation.
</StepItem>
</Step>

## Key Concepts

### ModalChat

The main React component you import and render. It displays a chat interface (typically as a floating button that opens a modal) and manages the conversation flow.

```tsx
import { ModalChat } from "@autoai-ui/autoui"

<ModalChat config={myConfig} />
```

### Config-Driven UI

Your `AutoUIConfig` object is the **contract** between your app and the AI assistant. It tells the LLM:
- What your app does (via `metadata.description` and `llm.appDescriptionPrompt`)
- What functions are available (via `functions`)
- What UI components can be rendered (via `components`)
- How to behave (via `runtime` settings)

### Plan & Steps

The LLM returns a **plan**—a structured JSON object that describes a sequence of actions. The runtime executes these steps in order, calling functions and rendering components as needed.

### Runtime

The AUTOUI runtime orchestrates plan execution. It:
- Validates LLM output (if `validateLLMOutput` is enabled)
- Executes function calls with proper error handling
- Renders components with provided props
- Manages conversation state and localStorage persistence
- Enforces `maxSteps` limits to prevent infinite loops

### Functions

Functions are JavaScript functions you register in your config. They can:
- Read application state
- Modify data
- Trigger side effects (API calls, navigation, etc.)
- Return data that becomes context for the LLM
So it is you who decides what functions modalChat can acess
### Components Registry

You can register React components that the LLM can render dynamically. This enables **generative UI**—the assistant can compose new interfaces on the fly based on user requests.

### Proxy-First LLM Access

AUTOUI uses a **proxy server** pattern for security:
- Your OpenRouter API key stays on the server
- The frontend only sends a client key (shared secret)
- The proxy handles authentication and rate limiting
- CORS and security policies are centralized

## When to Use AUTOUI

<Note title="Good fit" type="success">
- You want to add an AI assistant to an existing React app quickly
- You need config-driven behavior (no hardcoded chat flows)
- You want generative UI capabilities (LLM can render components dynamically)
- You prefer declarative configuration over imperative chat logic
- You need to integrate with OpenRouter or similar LLM providers
</Note>

## When Not to Use AUTOUI

<Note title="Consider alternatives" type="warning">
- You need full control over chat UI/UX (AUTOUI provides ModalChat, not a headless SDK)
- You're building a simple chatbot with fixed responses (overkill)
- You don't want to run a proxy server (though direct API key mode may be available)
- You need real-time streaming responses (AUTOUI uses request/response pattern)
- Your app isn't React-based
</Note>
